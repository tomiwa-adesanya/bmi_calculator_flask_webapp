# About

This is a Python Flask Web Application project aimed at developing a BMI Calculator. 

## Getting started

Open your terminal within a folder/directory of your choice and clone this remote repository.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tomiwa-adesanya/bmi_calculator_flask_webapp.git
```
A new folder will be created automatically named **bmi_calculator_flask_webapp**. Rename this folder if you wish and change terminal directory to this new 
folder.  It isn't compulsory to create a virtual environment, but it'd be a good practise to create one for every project you work on. 

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment after it has been successfully created.

```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

Install the required third-party packages using python pip. For this project, only the python *flask* third-party library is required.

```bash
pip install flask
```

Run python script to start server for the web-application. 

```bash
python app.py
```

Open your webbrowser and enter the url `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
